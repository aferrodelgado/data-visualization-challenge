# analysis
Based on the data and analysis below both Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be effective in reducing tumor volume at a higher level than other drugs in the study. There appears to be a significant positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, particularly in the Capomulin group, where we see a correlation coefficient of 0.84. This suggests heavier mice tend to have larger tumors. However, to further understand the dynamics between weight and tumor volume, it would be worth performing further anlysis with additional variables such as age and sex, for example, to see how those factors also influence the effectiveness of the treatment.
